# Banking-Analysis
The Banking Dashboard project focuses on understanding risk analytics in the financial sector and how data helps banks minimise losses while lending to customers. The dataset contains various client and banking details that help analyse customer behaviour, financial activity, and loan patterns. After cleaning and preparing the data, a Power BI dashboard was created to visually explore loans, deposits, engagement timelines, and overall client distribution. The dashboard highlights important insights such as which customers are more reliable, which banks attract more clients, and which nationalities or groups hold higher loan amounts. It also provides a clear view of different account balances and customer relationships. This helps banks make informed decisions when approving loans. The project demonstrates how modern data visualisation supports effective banking operations and risk management.
